# Linear-regression-excercise-in-R
Linear regression exercise in R for computer system evaluation course
1.	Give the coefficients of linear regression models for both the operating systems.
2.	Draw the plot linear regression model and the data points for both the operating systems.
3.	Write the equations of linear models for both the operating systems.
4.	Give the residual errors for both models.
5.	Give R2 values for both the models. Which model is more accurate?
6.	Draw four visual test verification graphs listed below for both the linear regression models. Discuss the findings in the graphs for both models.
  i.         Residuals vs. fitted values 
  ii.	Scale Location plots 
  iii.	Cookâ€™s distance plots.
  iv.	Q-Q plots
